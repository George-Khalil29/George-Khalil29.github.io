              <p class="description"> each with their own distinct cultures, languages, and histories. They have a deep connection to

              <p class="description">In Canada, land acknowledgments became more popular after the 2015 Truth and
                Reconciliation Commission report (which
                argued that the country's Indian residential school system had amounted to cultural genocide) and the
                election of a
                Liberal majority led by Justin Trudeau that same year. By 2019, they were a regular practice at events
                including
                National Hockey League games, ballet performances, and parliament meetings.</p>
