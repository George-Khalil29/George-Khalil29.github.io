          <h4>In Canada</h4>
          <p class="description">In Canada, land acknowledgments became more popular after the 2015 Truth and
            Reconciliation Commission report (which
            argued that the country's Indian residential school system had amounted to cultural genocide) and the
            election of a
            Liberal majority led by Justin Trudeau that same year. By 2019, they were a regular practice at events
            including
            National Hockey League games, ballet performances, and parliament meetings.</p>

        <div class="noteworthy">
          <h4>In United States</h4>
          <p class="description">In the United States, the practice of land acknowledgments has been gaining momentum as
            well. Early adopters included
            arts institutions, museums, institutions of higher education, non-profit organizations, local governments,
            and
            churches.After the 2020 Oscar land acknowledgment statement by <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taika_Waititi" target="_blank">Taika Waititi</a>
            , the practice has received more attention,
            both positively and negatively. Native Governance Center has resources on the topic of land acknowledgment,
            as do a
            number of sites geared toward colleges and universities.

          <h4>In Australia</h4>
          <p class="description">In Australia, the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_Country" target="_blank">Welcome to Country</a>
            to Country or Acknowledgement of Country is a ritual
            performed which is intended to highlight the cultural significance of the surrounding area to a particular
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians" target="_blank">Aboriginal Australians</a>
            or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders" target="_blank">Torres Strait
              Islanders</a>
            clan or language group. It has been performed since the
            1970s, becoming more common since the early 2000s. Significantly, a Welcome to Country must be performed
            by a Traditional Owner/Custodian of the land that you are currently on. It is important as a rejection of
            the colonial idea of terra nullius, which was overturned by the Mabo decision in 1992.

          <h4>In New Zealand</h4>
          <p class="description">In New Zealand, land acknowledgments recognize the indigenous 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people" target="_blank">Māori</a> and 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriori" target="_blank">Moriori</a>
            peoples. Māori words are commonly used in greetings of public speakers, acknowledgments of publications, and
            legislation to recognize their presence. Usage of Māori place names before English place names
            similarly acknowledges Māori relations with the place. In 2022, Te Pati Māori delivered a petition with
            70,000 signatures to the New Zealand Parliament which called to change the country's official name to its
            Māori name, Aotearoa.</p>
