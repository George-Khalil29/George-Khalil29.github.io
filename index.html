            <p class="description">Who are the traditional ancestors of this land? What other Indigenous people have
              ancestral connections to this land? What does unceded, unsurrendered mean? In Canada, The traditional
              ancestors of the land are the indigenous peoples who have inhabited the territory for thousands of years
              before the arrival of Europeans settlers. These indigenous peoples include First Nations, Metis, and Inuit
              peoples, each with their own distinct cultures, languages, and histories. They have a deep connection to
              the land and have played a crucial role in shaping Canada’s diverse cultural heritage. Unceded means that
              the land was never legally ceded, or given up to the Crown, through a treaty or other agreement.

              <p class="description">In Canada, land acknowledgments became more popular after the 2015 Truth and
                Reconciliation Commission report (which
                argued that the country's Indian residential school system had amounted to cultural genocide) and the
                election of a
                Liberal majority led by Justin Trudeau that same year. By 2019, they were a regular practice at events
                including
                National Hockey League games, ballet performances, and parliament meetings.</p>

              <p class="description">In the United States, the practice of land acknowledgments has been gaining
                momentum
                as
                well. Early adopters included
                arts institutions, museums, institutions of higher education, non-profit organizations, local
                governments,
                and
                churches.After the 2020 Oscar land acknowledgment statement by <a

                , the practice has received more attention,
                both positively and negatively. Native Governance Center has resources on the topic of land
                acknowledgment,
                as do a
                number of sites geared toward colleges and universities.

                to Country or Acknowledgement of Country is a ritual
                performed which is intended to highlight the cultural significance of the surrounding area to a

                clan or language group. It has been performed since the
                1970s, becoming more common since the early 2000s. Significantly, a Welcome to Country must be performed
                by a Traditional Owner/Custodian of the land that you are currently on. It is important as a rejection
                of
                the colonial idea of terra nullius, which was overturned by the Mabo decision in 1992.

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ori_people" target="_blank">Māori</a> and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moriori" target="_blank">Moriori</a>
                peoples. Māori words are commonly used in greetings of public speakers, acknowledgments of publications,
                and
                legislation to recognize their presence. Usage of Māori place names before English place names
                similarly acknowledges Māori relations with the place. In 2022, Te Pati Māori delivered a petition with
                70,000 signatures to the New Zealand Parliament which called to change the country's official name to
                its
                Māori name, Aotearoa.
