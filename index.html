            <p class="description">In Canada, land acknowledgments became more popular after the 2015 <a

                Reconciliation Commission report (which
                argued that the country's Indian residential school system had amounted to cultural genocide) and the
                election of a
                Liberal majority led by Justin Trudeau that same year. By 2019, they were a regular practice at events
                including
                National Hockey League games, ballet performances, and parliament meetings.</p>

            <h4>In United States</h4>
            <p class="description">In the United States, the practice of land acknowledgments has been gaining momentum
                as well. Early adopters included
                arts institutions, museums, institutions of higher education, non-profit organizations, local
                governments, and
                churches.After the 2020 Oscar land acknowledgment statement by <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taika_Waititi" target="_blank">Taika Waititi</a>
                , the practice has received more attention,
                both positively and negatively. Native Governance Center has resources on the topic of land
                acknowledgment, as do a
                number of sites geared toward colleges and universities.

            <img src="./images/Land Acknowledgement.jpg" alt="land Acknowlodgement In Australia">
            <p class="description">In Australia, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_Country"
                    target="_blank">Welcome to Country</a>
                or Acknowledgement of Country
                is a ritual performed which is intended to highlight the cultural significance of the
                surrounding area to a particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians"
                    target="_blank">Aboriginal Australians</a> Australian or Torres Strait Islander clan or
                language group. It has been performed since the 1970s, becoming more common since the early
                2000s. Significantly, a Welcome to Country must be performed by a Traditional Owner/Custodian of the
                land that you are currently on. It is important as a rejection of the colonial idea of terra nullius,
                which was overturned by the Mabo decision in 1992.

                peoples.Māori words are commonly used in greetings of public speakers, acknowledgments of publications,
                and legislation to recognize their presence. Usage of Māori place names before English place
                names similarly acknowledges Māori relations with the place. In 2022, Te Pati Māori delivered a
                petition with 70,000 signatures to the New Zealand Parliament which called to change the country's
                official name to its Māori name, Aotearoa.</p>
